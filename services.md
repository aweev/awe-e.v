Of course. This is an absolutely fantastic and incredibly detailed piece of work. The Prisma schema is comprehensive and well-structured, and your initial list of services is very much on the right track. This level of planning is exactly what's needed to tackle a project of this scale.

Let's break this down into a clear, actionable plan.

1. Confirmation and Refinement of Your Services

Your list of services is excellent. It correctly identifies the major domains of the application. Here is a confirmation of your list, with some minor refinements and clarifications to align them with a modern development approach (thinking in terms of logical modules or bounded contexts, which can be deployed as microservices or kept as modules within a monolith).

Proposed Service	Confirmation & Refinements	Core Responsibilities
Auth Service	Confirmed & Core	Manages user registration, login (password, OAuth), session management, token generation (password reset, email verification), MFA, and security policies (lockouts, password history). This is always the first service to build.
User Service	Confirmed & Core	Manages User, UserProfile, UserPreferences, Role, and Permission models. Handles CRUD for user data, role assignments, and profile completion. Tightly coupled with the Auth Service.
RBAC Service	Refinement: Integrate with User/Auth	Instead of a standalone service, this is a core capability within the User Service. It provides functions like can(user, action, resource) and manages the Permission and RolePermission tables.
CMS Service	Confirmed & Core	Manages Page, ContentBlock, PageTemplate, and all the Block* models. Handles the public-facing website content, page builder logic, multi-language content, and SEO configurations.
Program Service	Confirmed & Core	Manages Program, ProgramCategory, ProgramEnrolment, and ProgramParticipant. This is a central domain of your application.
Event Service	Confirmed & Core	Manages Event and EventRegistration. Handles event creation, scheduling, capacity management, and attendee tracking.
Success Story Service	Refinement: Combine with CMS	The SuccessStory model is content. It's best managed as a special content type within the CMS Service to keep content workflows (draft, review, publish) consistent. The service would handle submissions and connect stories to programs.
Donation Service	Confirmed & Core	Manages Donation, FundraisingCampaign, and integrates with payment gateways (Stripe, PayPal). Handles one-time/recurring payments, impact allocation, and receipting.
Volunteer Service	Confirmed & Core	Manages VolunteerOpportunity, VolunteerApplication, and VolunteerAssignment. Handles recruitment, skills matching, and tracking volunteer hours/impact.
Partnership Service	Confirmed & Core	Manages Partnership, Organization, PartnershipReport, etc. This is your mini-CRM for corporate and institutional partners.
Document Service	Confirmed & Core	Manages the Document and DocumentCategory models. Handles secure file uploads, access control (role-based), and versioning for internal documents like reports and policies.
Media Service	Confirmed (as Media Asset Service)	Manages the MediaAsset model. This is essentially your Cloudinary integration layer. It handles image/video uploads, transformations, optimization, and provides URLs to other services.
Notification Service	Confirmed & Foundational	Crucial cross-cutting concern. Manages Notification, NotificationTemplate, NotificationDelivery. It doesn't have business logic itself but is called by other services (e.g., Donation Service calls it to send a "Thank You" email).
Email Service	Refinement: Part of Notification Service	The Email Service (Mailchimp/Brevo integration) is a delivery channel for the Notification Service. The Notification Service decides what to send, and the Email channel handles the how. This also applies to Push and SMS.
Communication Service	Refinement: Combine into other services	Internal comms are features within other contexts. E.g., a "Mentor-Mentee Chat" is part of a Mentorship Service (see below). A "Newsletter" feature is part of a Marketing/Engagement Service.
Analytics Service	Confirmed & Foundational	Crucial cross-cutting concern. Manages collecting key events from all other services (e.g., user_registered, donation_made). It can either store simple metrics or push data to an external tool (Google Analytics, PostHog). The AnalyticsDashboard models would be part of this.
Audit Service	Confirmed & Foundational	Manages the AuditLog. Similar to Analytics but focused on security and compliance. It logs every state change (who, what, when). Must be integrated into every service that performs writes.
Search Service	Confirmed (but for later)	A dedicated service (using Elasticsearch, Algolia, etc.) that indexes data from other services to provide fast, site-wide search. Implemented after the core services are built.
Feature Flag Service	Confirmed & Foundational	Manages the FeatureFlag model. Crucial for modern development. Allows you to deploy incomplete features, perform A/B tests, and enable/disable functionality without a code change. This should be built very early.
Onboarding Service	Confirmed	Manages the Onboarding* models. Guides new users through initial setup steps based on their role.
(New) Mentorship Service	Recommended Addition	Your schema has MentorshipRequest and MentorshipSession. This is a distinct domain and warrants its own service/module to manage matching, session tracking, and communication between mentors and mentees.
(New) Survey Service	Recommended Addition	Manages the Survey, SurveyQuestion, and SurveyResponse models. Handles creation, distribution, and collection of feedback.
2. The Implementation Roadmap: A Phased Approach to Avoid Re-writes

You cannot build everything at once. The key is to build foundational layers first, then add business value on top, integrating cross-cutting concerns at each step. This order is designed to minimize dependencies on things that don't exist yet.

Phase 0: The Bedrock (Sprint 0)

Goal: Prepare the development environment. No user-facing features.

Project Setup: Initialize Next.js project, setup Prisma, establish coding standards (ESLint, Prettier).

Infrastructure: Setup PostgreSQL database. Configure Vercel for hosting. Setup CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions for testing and deployment).

Core Libraries: Install and configure UI component library (e.g., Shadcn/UI, MUI), state management, and testing libraries.

Phase 1: Foundation - Users, Access & Core Tooling

Goal: A user can sign up, log in, and an admin can manage them. The core tooling for all future development is in place.

Feature Flag Service:

Implement the FeatureFlag model and a simple service/hook (useFeatureFlag('flag_key')).

Reasoning: Every single feature from this point on should be wrapped in a feature flag. This is your most powerful tool for avoiding deployment bottlenecks and enabling gradual rollouts.

Auth & User Services:

Implement User model, registration, login (password-based first), and session management (UserSession).

Implement basic RBAC logic (User roles field, Permission model). Create a Super Admin role.

Build the basic Admin Panel UI for user management (view users, assign roles).

Notification Service (Engine Only):

Build the core engine (NotificationDelivery, NotificationTemplate).

Integrate an email provider (Mailchimp/Brevo).

Implement only the essential transactional notifications: "Welcome Email" and "Password Reset".

Reasoning: You need notifications for auth flows immediately. Building the core engine now means you only add new templates later, not a whole new system.

Audit & Analytics Services (Skeletons):

Create the AuditLog and ActivityLog models and a simple audit.log() function.

Integrate audit.log() into the Auth/User services for critical events (user_registered, password_changed, role_assigned).

Reasoning: Establishing the pattern of logging/analytics from day one is critical for security and future insights. You instrument features as you build them.

Phase 2: Content & Programs - The Public Face

Goal: The public website is live with core content and program information. The admin can manage this content.

Media Asset (Cloudinary) Service:

Integrate Cloudinary SDK.

Build a service to handle uploads and transformations.

Create a simple media library UI in the Admin Panel.

CMS Service:

Implement Page, ContentBlock, PageTemplate and a few basic block types (BlockHero, BlockTextContent, BlockGallery).

Build the Admin Panel UI for creating and managing pages (a simple page builder).

Build the frontend rendering logic in Next.js for these pages and blocks.

Launch the basic public site (Home, About, Contact pages).

Program Service:

Implement Program and ProgramCategory models.

Build the Admin Panel UI for CRUD operations on programs.

Create public-facing program list and detail pages using the CMS.

Integrations: Add audit.log() for all program changes.

Success Story Service (as part of CMS):

Implement SuccessStory model.

Add a new "Success Story" content type to the CMS.

Create a simple public-facing submission form (FormSubmission model).

Integrations:

Notification: Send "New Story Submitted for Review" to admins.

Phase 3: Engagement - Donations & Volunteering

Goal: The website can now accept donations and volunteer applications, the two primary resources for the organization.

Donation Service:

Implement Donation and FundraisingCampaign models.

Integrate Stripe for payment processing.

Add a donation form to the public website.

Build an Admin Panel UI to view donations and manage campaigns.

Integrations:

Notification: Send "Donation Thank You" email.

Analytics: Track donation_completed event with amount and campaign.

Audit: Log all financial transactions.

Volunteer Service:

Implement VolunteerOpportunity, VolunteerApplication, and VolunteerAssignment models.

Build public pages for listing opportunities and an application form.

Build Admin Panel UI for reviewing applications and managing opportunities.

Integrations:

Notification: "Application Received" to user, "New Application to Review" to admin.

Analytics: Track volunteer_application_submitted.

Phase 4: Portals & Community - Deepening Relationships

Goal: Logged-in users (volunteers, alumni, partners) have a dedicated, valuable experience.

Members-Only Portal Foundation:

Create the basic logged-in layout, dashboard, and profile editing pages (UserProfile model).

Implement OAuth providers (Google, etc.) for easier login.

Volunteer Portal Features:

Show volunteers their assignments, hours, and relevant training materials (Document Service).

Document Service: Implement Document model and Admin UI for uploading training materials with role-based access.

Partnership Service:

Implement Partnership, Organization, and related models.

Build Admin Panel UI for managing partners (the mini-CRM).

Create a basic portal view for corporate partners to see their impact reports (initially just links to PDFs managed via the Document Service).

Mentorship & Survey Services:

Build out the Mentorship and Survey services.

These add immense value to the community and can be introduced now that a stable user base exists.

Phase 5: Intelligence & Scaling - Optimization

Goal: Use the data collected to improve the user experience and scale the system.

Advanced Analytics & Reporting:

Build the AnalyticsDashboard and DashboardWidget features.

Create a reporting engine to generate financial and impact reports.

Search Service:

Integrate a search provider (e.g., Algolia).

Index Programs, News, Events, and Success Stories.

Add site-wide search to the public website and portals.

Personalization & AI:

Use analytics data to build a content recommendation engine.

Implement AI-powered matching for volunteers to opportunities or mentors to mentees.

Performance & Security:

Conduct performance audits (Core Web Vitals).

Implement advanced caching strategies.

Conduct security audits and penetration testing.

By following this phased approach, you build components in a logical order, ensure foundational services are available when needed, and continuously deliver value without having to go back and re-architect core parts of the system.
